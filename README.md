AI-Powered-Automated-Attendance-System-with-Face-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-
This project is an attendance system that uses face recognition technology to identify and mark the attendance of individuals in a video. It can be used in educational institutions or organizations to automate the attendance process.

Overview
The project performs the following tasks:

Recognizes faces in a given video.
Matches the detected faces with known faces from a training dataset.
Marks attendance by recording the names, roll numbers, and classes of recognized individuals.
Generates an attendance report in a CSV file.
Installation
